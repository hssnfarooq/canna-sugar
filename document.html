        <h3>LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
        <p>
          The Company has used reasonable endeavours to approach the Token Sale
          in a responsible and sensible manner. Given the legal uncertain of
          distributed ledger technologies, businesses and activities as well as
          cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related businesses and activities
          in a number of jurisdictions, the Company has spent time and resources
          to consider its business approach and where it proposes to operate now
          and in the future. As such, it is possible that the Company’s CANNA
          SUGAR tokens described in this White Paper and which are the subject
          of the Token Sale (the “Tokens”) may comprise a security in your
          jurisdiction or the offer for sale by the Company of the Tokens in
          your jurisdiction may be a regulated or prohibited activity and in
          either of these cases the Company may be liable for the same. The
          Company accepts no responsibility or liability to you in these or any
          other circumstances. You are strongly advised to take independent
          legal advice in respect of the legality in your jurisdiction of your
          participation in the Token Sale and purchase of Tokens
        </p>

        <p>
          The Tokens are functional utility tokens designed for use only on the
          Company’s business platform that is yet to be developed. The Tokens
          are NOT securities. In the event that you purchase Tokens, your
          purchase cannot be refunded or exchanged. The Company does not
          recommend purchasing Tokens for speculative investment purposes.
          Tokens do not entitle you to any equity, governance, voting or similar
          right or entitlement in the Company or in any of its affiliated
          companies. Tokens are sold as digital products, similar to
          downloadable software, digital music and the like. The Company does
          not recommend that you purchase Tokens unless you have prior
          experience with utility tokens, blockchain-based software and
          distributed ledger technology and unless you have taken independent
          professional advice

        <h3>RISK FACTORS</h3>
        <p>
          You should carefully consider and evaluate each of the following risk
          factors and all other information contained in these Terms before
          deciding to participate in the Token Sale. To the best of the
          Company’s knowledge and belief, all risk factors which are material to
          you in making an informed judgment to participate in the Token Sale
          have been set out below. If any of the following considerations,
          uncertainties or material risks develops into actual events, the
          business, financial position and/or results of operations of the
          Company and the maintenance and level of usage of the Tokens could be
          materially and adversely affected. In such cases, the trading price of
          Tokens (in the case where they are listed on an exchange or market
          (regulated, unregulated, primary, secondary or otherwise)) could
          decline due to any of these considerations, uncertainties or material
          risks, and you may lose all or part of your Tokens or the economic
          value thereof.
        </p>

        <h3>RISKS RELATING TO PARTICIPATION IN THE TOKEN SALE</h3>

        <h3>
          There is no prior market for Tokens and the Token Sale may not result
          in an active or liquid market for the Tokens.
        </h3>

        <p>
          Prior to the Token Sale, there has been no public market for the
          Tokens. In the event that the Company ever decides to seek the
          approval for availability of the Tokens for trading on a
          cryptocurrency exchange or market, there is no assurance that such
          approval will be obtained. Furthermore, even if such approval is
          granted by a cryptocurrency exchange, there is no assurance that an
          active or liquid trading market for the Tokens will develop, or if
          developed, will be sustained after the Tokens have been made available
          for trading on such market. There is also no assurance that the market
          price of the Tokens will not decline below the original or issue
          purchase price (the “Purchase Price”). The Purchase Price may not be
          indicative of the market price of the Tokens after they have been made
          available for trading on a marke
        </p>

        <p>
          A Token is not a currency issued by any central bank or national,
          supra-national or quasi-national organization, nor is it backed by any
          hard assets or other credit nor is it a commodity in the traditional
          sense of that word. The Company is not responsible for, nor does it
          pursue, the circulation and trading of Tokens on any market. Trading
          of Tokens will merely depend on the consensus on its value between the
          relevant market participants. No one is obliged to purchase any Token
          from any holder of the Token, including the purchasers, nor does
          anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price of Tokens to any extent
          at any time. Furthermore, Tokens may not be resold to purchasers who
          are citizens, nationals, residents (tax or otherwise) and/or green
          card holders of Restricted Jurisdictions or to Restricted Persons or
          to purchasers in any other jurisdiction where the purchase of Tokens
          may be in violation of applicable laws. Accordingly, the Company
          cannot ensure that there will be any demand or market for Tokens, or
          that the Purchase Price is indicative of the market price of Tokens
          after they have been made available for trading on any cryptocurrency
          exchange or market.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Future sales or issuance of the Tokens could materially and adversely
          affect the market price of Tokens
        </h3>

        <p>
          Any future sale or issuance of the Tokens would increase the supply of
          Tokens in the market and this may result in a downward price pressure
          on the Token. The sale or distribution of a significant number of
          Tokens outside of the Token Sale (including but not limited to the
          sales of Tokens undertaken after the completion of the initial crowd
          sale, issuance of Tokens to persons other than purchasers for purposes
          of community initiatives, business development, academic research,
          education and market expansion and issuance of Tokens as a reward to
          users of the Company’s business platform that is yet to be developed
          or otherwise), or the perception that such further sales or issuance
          may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the Tokens.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Negative publicity may materially and adversely affect the price of
          the Tokens.
        </h3>

        <p>
          Negative publicity involving the Company, the Company’s that is yet to
          be developed, the Tokens or any of the key personnel of the Company
          and/or regulation of distributed ledger technologies, cryptocurrencies
          and/or crowdsales of tokens in any jurisdiction, may materially and
          adversely affect the market perception or market price of the Tokens,
          whether or not it is justified.
        </p>

        <h3>
          The Company may not be able to pay any anticipated rewards in the
          future.
        </h3>
        <p>
          There is no assurance that there will be sufficient engagement in the
          Company’s business platform that is yet to be developed such that you
          will receive any rewards anticipated to be distributed to active users
          of the Company’s business platform. Further, even in the event there
          is substantial engagement and interactions among the users of the
          Company’s business platform that is yet to be developed, there is no
          assurance you personally will receive any part of the rewards. This is
          because the ability of the Company to pay any reward to you will
          depend on the future results of operations and the future business and
          financial condition of the Company, and there is no assurance of the
          future results of operations and the future business and financial
          condition of the Company.
        </p>

        <h3>
          There is no assurance of any success of the Company’s Token Sale or
          business platform that is yet to be developed as envisioned by the
          Available Information.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The value of, and demand for, the Tokens hinges heavily on the
          performance of the Company’s Token Sale and business platform that is
          yet to be developed and the continuous active engagement of its users
          and success of its contemplated business lines. There is no assurance
          that the Company’s Token Sale will be successful or that its business
          platform that is yet to be developed will gain or continue to gain
          traction. While the Company has made every effort to provide a
          realistic estimate, there is also no assurance that the
          cryptocurrencies raised in the Token Sale will be sufficient for the
          development of the Company’s business platform. For the foregoing or
          any other reason, the development of the Company’s business platform
          and launch of the anticipated Token functionality may not be completed
          and there is no assurance that it will be launched at all. As such,
          distributed Tokens may hold little or no worth or value and this would
          impact any trading price and/or use of the Tokens.
        </p>

        <h3>
          The trading price of the Tokens may fluctuate following the Token
          Sale.
        </h3>

        <p>
          The prices of utility tokens in general tend to be relatively
          volatile, and can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time.
          The demand for, and the corresponding market price of, the Tokens may
          fluctuate significantly and rapidly in response to, among others, the
          following factors, some of which are beyond the control of the
          Company:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>new technical innovations;</li>
          <li>
            analysts’ speculations, recommendations, perceptions or estimates of
            the Token’s market price or the Company’s financial and business
            performance;
          </li>
          <li>
            changes in market valuations and token prices of entities with
            businesses similar to that of the Company that may be listed on the
            same cryptocurrency exchanges or markets as the Tokens;
          </li>
          <li>
            announcements by the Company of significant events, for example
            partnerships, sponsorships or new product developments;
          </li>
          <li>
            fluctuations in market prices and trading volume of cryptocurrencies
            on cryptocurrency exchanges or markets;
          </li>
          <li>additions or departures of key personnel of the Company;</li>
          <li>
            success or failure of the Company’s management in implementing
            business and growth strategies; and/or
          </li>
          <li>
            changes in conditions affecting the blockchain or financial
            technology industry, the general economic conditions or market
            sentiments, or other events or factors.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          The funds raised in the Token Sale are exposed to risks of theft.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Company may make every effort to ensure that the funds received by
          it from Token Sale will be securely held through the implementation of
          security measures. Notwithstanding such security measures, there is no
          assurance that there will be no theft of the cryptocurrencies as a
          result of hacks, sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of
          service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects on the Token Sale
          website, in the smart contract(s) on which the escrow wallet and the
          Token Sale relies, on the Ethereum blockchain or any other blockchain,
          or otherwise. Such events may include, for example, flaws in
          programming or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof.
          In such event, even if the Token Sale is completed, the Company may
          not be able to receive the cryptocurrencies raised and the Company may
          not be able to use such funds for the development of the Company’s
          business platform. In such case, the launch of the Company’s business
          platform might be temporarily or permanently curtailed. As such,
          distributed Tokens may hold little worth or value and this would
          impact their trading price.
        </p>
        <h3>RISKS RELATING TO THE COMPANY</h3>

        <h3>The Company’s business platform that is yet to be developed.</h3>

        <p>
          Any events or circumstances which adversely affect the Company or any
          of its successor or affiliated operating entities may have a
          corresponding adverse effect on the Company’s business platform that
          is yet to be developed, including but not limited to the development,
          structuring and launch of the Company’s business platform. Such
          adverse effects would correspondingly have an impact on the utility,
          liquidity, and the trading price of the Tokens.
        </p>

        <h3>
          The Company may be materially and adversely affected if it fails to
          effectively manage its operations as its business develops and
          evolves, which would have a direct impact on its ability to develop,
          maintain or operate the Company’s business platform and/or develop,
          structure and/or license any Token functionality.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The financial technology and cryptocurrency industries in which the
          Company competes have grown rapidly over the past few years and
          continue to evolve in response to new technological advances, changing
          business models, shifting regulations and other factors. As a result
          of this constantly changing environment, the Company may face
          operational difficulties in adjusting to the changes, and the
          sustainability of the Company will depend on its ability to manage its
          operations, ensure that it hires qualified and competent employees,
          and provides proper training for its personnel. As its business
          evolves, the Company must also expand and adapt its operational
          infrastructure. The Company’s business will in part rely on its
          blockchain-based software systems, cryptocurrency wallets or other
          related token storage mechanisms, blockchain technology and smart
          contract technology. All of these systems, tools, and skillsets
          represent complex, costly, and rapidly changing technical
          infrastructure. In order to demonstrate continued ability to
          effectively manage technical support infrastructure for the Company’s
          business platform that is yet to be developed and the future
          functionality of the Tokens, the Company will need to continue to
          upgrade and improve its data systems and other operational systems,
          procedures, and controls. These upgrades and improvements will require
          a dedication of resources and are likely to be complex and
          increasingly rely on hosted computer services from third parties that
          the Company does not or will not control. If the Company is unable to
          adapt its systems and organization in a timely, efficient, and
          cost-effective manner to accommodate changing circumstances, its
          business, financial condition and/or results of operations may be
          adversely affected. If the third parties whom the Company relies on
          are subject to a security breach or otherwise suffer disruptions that
          impact the services the Company uses, the integrity and availability
          of its internal information could be compromised, which may
          consequently cause the loss of confidential or proprietary information
          and/or economic loss. The loss of financial, labor or other resources,
          and any other adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial
          condition and/or operations, would have a direct adverse effect on the
          Company’s ability to develop maintain or operate the Company’s
          business platform and/or to develop, structure and/or license the
          anticipated Token functionality. Any adverse effects affecting the
          Company business or technology are likely to also adversely impact the
          utility, liquidity, and trading price of the Tokens.

          The Company may experience system failures, unplanned interruptions in
          its network or services, hardware or software defects, security
          breaches or other causes that could adversely affect the Company’s
          infrastructure network, and/or the Company’s business platform that is
          yet to be developed.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Company’s network or services, which would include the Company’s
          business platform that is yet to be developed and, if successfully
          structured, developed, licensed and launched, the Token functionality,
          could be disrupted by numerous events, including natural disasters,
          equipment breakdown, network connectivity downtime, power losses, or
          even intentional disruptions of its services, such as disruptions
          caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorized users, some of
          which are beyond the Company’s control. There can be no assurance that
          cyber-attacks, such as distributed denials of service, will not be
          attempted in the future or that the Company’s security measures will
          be effective. The Company may be prone to attacks on its
          infrastructure intended to steal information about its technology,
          financial data or user information or take other actions that would be
          damaging to the Company and/or holders of the Tokens. Any significant
          breach of the Company’s security measures or other disruptions
          resulting in a compromise of the usability, stability, and security of
          the Company’s business platform that is yet to be developed may
          adversely affect the utility, liquidity and/or trading price of the
          Tokens.
        </p>

        <h3>
          The Company may in the future be dependent in part on the location and
          data center facilities of third parties.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Company’s future infrastructure network may be established in
          whole or in part through servers which it owns and/or houses at the
          location facilities of third parties, and/or servers that it rents at
          data center facilities of third parties. If the Company is unable to
          renew its data facility leases on commercially reasonable terms or at
          all, the Company may be required to transfer its servers to a new data
          center facility, and may incur significant costs and possible service
          interruption in connection with the relocation. These facilities are
          also vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among others, natural
          disasters, arson, terrorist attacks, power losses, and
          telecommunication failures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the third-party providers of such facilities may suffer
          a breach of security as a result of third-party action, employee
          error, malfeasance or otherwise, and a third party may obtain
          unauthorized access to the data in such servers. The Company and the
          providers of such facilities may be unable to anticipate these
          techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.
        </p>

        <h3>
          General global market and economic conditions may have an adverse
          impact on the Company’s operating performance, results of operations
          and/or cash flows.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Company could continue to be affected by general global economic
          and market conditions. Challenging economic conditions worldwide have
          from time to time, contributed, and may continue to contribute, to
          slowdowns in the information technology industry at large. Weakness in
          the economy could have a negative effect on the Company’s business,
          operations and financial condition, including decreases in revenue and
          operating cash flows, and inability to attract future equity and/or
          debt financing on commercially reasonable terms. Additionally, in a
          down-cycle economic environment, the Company may experience the
          negative effects of a slowdown in trading and usage of the Company’s
          business platform that is yet to be developed and may delay or cancel
          the development, structuring, licensing and/or launch of the
          anticipated Token functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppliers on which the Company relies for servers, bandwidth, location
          and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic
          conditions that, in turn, could have a negative impact on the
          Company’s operations or expenses. There can be no assurance,
          therefore, that current economic conditions or worsening economic
          conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a
          significant, adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial
          condition and results of operations, and hence, the Company’s business
          platform that is yet to be developed and/or the ability to develop,
          structure, license and/or launch any Token functionality. Any such
          circumstances would then correspondingly negatively impact the
          utility, liquidity, and/or trading price of the Tokens.
        </p>
        <h3>
          The Company or the Tokens may be affected by newly implemented
          regulations.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Distributed ledger technologies, businesses and activities as well as
          cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related businesses and activities
          are generally unregulated worldwide, but numerous regulatory
          authorities across jurisdictions have been outspoken about considering
          the implementation of regulatory regimes which govern distributed
          ledger technologies, businesses and activities as well as
          cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related businesses and activities.
          The Company or the Tokens may be affected by newly implemented
          regulations relating to distributed ledger technologies, businesses
          and activities as well as cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related
          businesses and activities, including having to take measures to comply
          with such regulations, or having to deal with queries, notices,
          requests or enforcement actions by regulatory authorities, which may
          come at a substantial cost and may also require substantial
          modifications to the Company’s business platform that is yet to be
          developed and/or the anticipated Token functionality. This may impact
          the appeal or practicality or functionality of the Company’s business
          platform that is yet to be developed and/or the anticipated Token
          functionality for users and result in decreased usage of and demand
          for the Company’s business platform and the Tokens. Further, should
          the costs (financial or otherwise) of complying with such newly
          implemented regulations exceed a certain threshold, maintaining the
          Company’s business platform that is yet to be developed and/or
          developing, structuring, licensing and/or launching the Token
          functionality may no longer be commercially viable, and the Company
          may opt to discontinue the Company’s business platform that is yet to
          be developed and/or the anticipated Token functionality, and/or the
          Tokens. Further, it is difficult to predict how or whether governments
          or regulatory authorities may implement any changes to laws and
          regulations affecting distributed ledger technology and its
          applications, including the Company’s business platform that is yet to
          be developed and/or the anticipated Token functionality, and/or the
          Tokens.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Company may also have to cease operations in a jurisdiction that
          makes it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or make it
          commercially unviable or undesirable to obtain the necessary
          regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction. In scenarios
          such as the foregoing, the utility, liquidity, and/or trading price of
          Tokens will be adversely affected and/or Tokens may cease to be
          traded.
        </p>
        <h3>There may be unanticipated risks arising from the Tokens.</h3>
        <p>
          Utility tokens such as the Tokens are a relatively new and dynamic
          technology. In addition to the risks included in the above discussion
          of risk factors, there are other risks associated with your purchase,
          holding, and use of the Tokens, including those that the Company
          cannot anticipate. Such risks may further appear as unanticipated
          variations or combinations of the risks discussed above.
        </p>

        <h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
        <p>
          By purchasing Tokens, you agree to your personal data, (i.e., your
          email address, name, address and other details personal to you) being
          processed by the Company for its business purposes or the purposes of

          platform that is yet to be developed and the Tokens. The Company
